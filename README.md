# samplecode
Here's where I put up some of the sample code I've written as a result of learning to code.

I'm a Product Manager by trade, and I've worked in the game industry and the enterprise technology industry doing QA, business development, game production, product management, team management and some UX work.

Initially, I wasn't technical - I graduated with a degree in Psychology and I've self-learned (by reading, asking, doing) everything I know now about building products.

Some technical things I've learned over the years (in order from first to last):
- What FTP is and how to use an FTP client
- SVN and version control
- The difference between data and code, which helped me identify bugs and write bug reports easily early on in my career
- Scripts help automate the boring things - our programmers were able to build our games, upload them, and post them on Basecamp via scripts without staying up late to finish that
- Pros and cons to using Git vs SVN
- Wireframing is the term for what I've been doing prior to game production work
- Prototyping tools are amazing, but usually means you need good visual designs
- HTML5 and CSS, using Bootstrap (but I'd really rather not do front-end coding)
- Computer science basics (bits, bytes, 1s and 0s)
- Python
- Swift
- Product documentation in the form of specs can be very, very helpful
- Reading PHP code
- Back-end architectures (monolith vs microservices)
- How database and UI design affect API design
- SQL is an awesome way of pulling data to analyse it; in the right hands, it's more efficient than a spreadsheet because of the logic that can go into it
