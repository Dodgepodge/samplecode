# samplecode
Here's where I put up some of the sample code I've written as a result of learning to code.

I'm a Product Manager by trade, and I've worked in the game industry and the enterprise technology industry.

Initially, I wasn't technical - I graduated with a degree in Psychology and I've self-learned (by reading, asking, doing) everything I know now about building products.
